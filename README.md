# hello-world
Find the latest in streetwear, sneakers, accessories and all the hypiest stuff! 
I'm just a normal guy who loves to find and aquire some awesome deadstock items.  Choose from BAPE, Supreme, Nike, Jordan, Palace, Nocta, oVo, Chinatown Market, Be@rBricks, Kaws, Champion, Kith, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, and many more!
Most everything is new, unworn, new-in-the-box.  And the prices (unless I'm somehow emotionally attached) are all super aggressive to make it cheaper to choose this site than StockX, Grailed, Mercari or others.
Now at the least, check out what I have at www.shopthetortoise.com and if you find something you love, we'll get it to you at a fair price and as fast as I can!
